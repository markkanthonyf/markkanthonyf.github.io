                        Hey! My name is Marcus Fenn. I was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. I attended Idaho Fine Arts Academy for high school
                        where I learned and majored in theater. One thing committing to that field for so long, 7 years to be exact, is that
                        it was not what I wanted to do with my life. I would often catch myself being jelous over the visual art majors and
                        all the incredible projects they worked on. I was in love with cartoons and animations and everything that I wasn't
                        doing. So once I graduated, I decided to change that. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently attending Boise State University in the Gaming and Interactive Media and Mobile major - or GIMM for
                        short. It was here that I decided I wanted to hone my artistic and animation skills.
