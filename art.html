                        <p>When I was a kid, I would have never expected to be making an art portfolio. I was always, as embarassing as this may be, a
                            theater kid. Of course, I always had a knack for doodling during class and wishing I could be in the design,
                            visual arts, or clay-making classes, but it just never came to fruition.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This was until 2015 when I got my first iPad and pen. Was I good at drawing? Of course not, but it was such an interesting form
                            of expression that I hadn't been able to utilize before. I drew fanart, original characters, scenes, monsters! You name it,
                            I drew it. It was something that I truly grew to love.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This first piece was made in 2016. One of my friends had asked me to draw her character and I couldn't have been more excited.
                            You could say, this was my first commission too. This was the first attempt of me putting everything I have learned over the year
                            to use. Room for improvement, obviously, but I was proud and still am proud at where I started.</p>

                                One of the best things to come with your art is your creativity. This is evident in the pieces I made and how much they've
                                changed over time. Over the year between 2016 and 2017 I was beginning to explore different worlds and creatures of my own creation.
                                This - the creation of life - of my own imagination - is what pulled me to art and animation. This is why I love it so much.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The second piece in this portfolio was made in 2017. Catch the theme yet? At first I wanted to make a robot and its soul. 
                                But the strange and beautiful thing about art and design is that its always prone to change. Unless it's for something professional,
                                who's to tell you what you can or can't make? About half-way through the creation of this image, it changed from a lost robot to
                                an honestly edgy looking alien. He wasn't tied to any story or world, just a simple character that I made. Of course, with his Ghost
                                as well.

                                What's something an artist always learns in art theory? That's right, color theory!
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                The problem with never taking professional art classes and learning how to draw yourself, is that you don't immediatley learn
                                what looks good and what doesn't. It's all about trial and error. It takes a long time for a person to put to colors together
                                and realize what'll catch a person's eye. Or what will genuinly make them sick. Somehow I did the latter quite a lot. Color theory
                                was something I really needed to get better at. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This piece was done in 2018; making it one of the first artworks that I actually tried to do multiple professional things. 1) make
                                something that's colors look good and 2) try a different brush type. I had gotten into a habit of using one kind of pen because I was
                                convinced that's all I needed. But look at how much better this piece is from the last! Just because I didn't use the fine-pen.

                                Up until now, everything I have made was from my own head. Nothing was copied (besides Rumumoric's design, of course); nothing was
                                used to really push my artistic skill. This changed in 2019. I realized that in order for me to become a better artist, I needed
                                to push myself outside my comfort zone. Really try something new. All my pieces up to this point had been simple head-shots or still body
                                poses. Nothing more or less. That needed to change.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This was an art piece I made in 2019. What did I do that was so different than the others? Well, I studied someone. I actually observed how
                                the human anatomy worked. Which, might I say, is something even more incredible in it of itself. If you're an artist, especially a character
                                designer, you have to appreciate how beautiful the human body is. Anyway, I digress. I used a live video of a woman slowly moving into different
                                poses. This is the one that spoke most to me, so I drew it. It has forever become one of my most favorite drawings I have ever made.

                                Of course, not everything is about digital art. In fact, it's not even my favorite media to use. My all time favorite is the simple
                                pencil and paper. There's something so incredible in something that's so simple. Some of my better art works have all be on pencil
                                and paper. The rigidess and roughness of the sketches brings out a kind of fascination that I can't get anywhere else.

                                <br>
                                This was made in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. I wanted to make a character so in love with power that he went insane.
                                Personally, I think I did pretty well. This was also a piece I did to test my ability to draw the male anatomy. Still just a bust
                                shot, but one of my prouder works.

                            One of the best things about art is that you get to see yourself grow. Just look at the difference between 2016 and now. Time and
                            practice truly does wonders for artists, or truly anything that takes patience. Game Designers and the comprehencion of code, dancers
                            becoming more comfortable in their body, singers making a stronger voice. It's all and alwasys will be about the time you take
                            to practice.

                            We're finally up to date. But what's something I still haven't mentioned? Something that really should have been worked on years and
                            years ago? Yep, that's right, shading. Guess what that ties into once again? Color theory! My hatred for it will never cease. But this
                            was different. I knew I needed to work on it, so in this piece, I took my time to understand how the sun affects a person's face.

                            in 2022, I grew to appreciate what shapes different brushes created on a canvas. So, mixing the two together, I created this. Just like when
                            I did my art study on anatomy, this has become one of my favorite art pieces I have ever made. There seems to be a theme between learning
                            somethin new and testing it.

                            I wonder what I'll learn next.
